# pong-game
This is a python code written to implement a minimal game of pong, although there is no score board. Explore the code to understand more.
This piece of code is written using jupyter notebook. I have created high fps, pong game, using basic pygame commands, and object oriented 
programming concepts. Any advice to improve the game will be highly appreciated. No graphics work is added in this case, just to keep it 
simple.
